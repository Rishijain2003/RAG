RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Project: Bhagavad Gita
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system centered on the Bhagavad Gita. It leverages GPT-4.0 Mini from OpenAI as the generative model, LangChain for orchestration, Chroma as the vector database, and Gradio for the user interface.

Overview
The RAG system combines information retrieval with a generative model to provide accurate and contextualized answers. In this project:

The Bhagavad Gita text is pre-processed and stored as vector embeddings in the Chroma database.
GPT-4.0 Mini generates human-like responses augmented by the retrieved context.
A Gradio interface enables users to interact with the system seamlessly.

Features
Custom Dataset: The Bhagavad Gita text forms the foundation of the RAG system, enabling spiritual and philosophical Q&A.
Vector Database: Chroma is used to store and retrieve embeddings of the text.
Generative Model: GPT-4.0 Mini provides conversational responses enriched with retrieved context.
User Interface: A simple, user-friendly Gradio interface for interaction.

Project Architecture
Preprocessing:

The Bhagavad Gita text is split into manageable chunks using LangChain's text splitter.
Each chunk is embedded using a pre-trained embedding model and stored in Chroma.
Retrieval:

When a user submits a query, the system retrieves the most relevant chunks from the vector database.
Generation:

GPT-4.0 Mini generates a response based on the retrieved context and the user query.
Interface:

The system is accessible through a Gradio web interface, enabling real-time interaction.



Technologies Used
LangChain: Orchestrates the RAG pipeline, including text splitting, retrieval, and query generation.
Chroma: A high-performance vector database for efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings.
GPT-4.0 Mini: OpenAI's generative model for creating context-aware responses.
Gradio: Provides a lightweight and intuitive web interface for users to interact with the RAG system.
Python: The programming language used for implementation.
